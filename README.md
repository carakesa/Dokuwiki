## Dokuwiki to Track My Musings

18 Mar 2023

    I've long griped that the web has become a place to sell things and push ideas rather than share knowledge.  After stumbling across nikitavoloboev's site:  https://wiki.nikiv.dev/ 

    I lack any creativity of my own, but I was inspired to follow suit and see what I can come up with.  Plus it gives me a reason to write more and force me to make more notes about what I'm doing.
    I'm sure this will mostly focus on my foray deeper into Linux (and keeping better records of all my changes without) seperate from my dotfiles.  Other random musings will likey involve RF Spectrum and work related things that I can publicly archive that may be of use to other people.
