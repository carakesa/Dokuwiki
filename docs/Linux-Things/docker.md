# Docker
  
    Oh how I love to hate thee.

Most of my Docker images are hosted on a Pi, and my Pi's are running "DietPi" for the OS.  It's great (usually).

But Docker uses YAML whose quite particular about spaces, and currently I'm editing those files in nano which isn't quite configured to handle things like "tabs to spaces".
